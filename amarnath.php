                <h2 class=" bg-white text-start text-primary " style="text-decoration: underline;">AMARNATH JI :</h2>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">Every year tens of thousands of Hindu devotees visit this cave, located
                    in the heart of the Himalayas. It is a two hour drive from Pahalgam to Chandanwari and then a trek,
                    which people tread on foot or riding ponies.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">So if you are a devotee and you want to have the most tranquil,
                    spiritual time-Amarnath cave is the answer. There are helicopter services available to the cave as
                    well, while Langars line the trek route providing free food.
                </p>

                <h6>VIA PAHALGAM & BALTAL ROUTES</h6>

                <h6>VIA PAHALGAM</h6>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">Situated 96 Kms from Srinagar, Pahalgam is known all over the world for
                    its beauty. Lidder and Aru Rivers and high mountains kiss the valley. Good Hotels are available for
                    accommodation. Arrangements for free Langars (food kiosks) are also made by Non Government
                    Organisations at Nunwan Yatri Camp, 6 kms. short of Pahalgam. Pilgrims camp at Pahalgam for the
                    first night. Sheshnag – is actually a mountain which derives its name from its Seven Peaks,
                    resembling the heads of the mythical snake. The second night’s camp at Sheshnag overlooks the deep
                    blue waters of Sheshnag lake, and glaciers beyond. There are legends of love and revenge too
                    associated with Sheshnag, and at the camp these are narrated by campfires. The stillness of the
                    Himalayan night increases your inner joy. Once you take bath and enjoy the scenic view, life takes a
                    whole new meaning altogether. On the way to The Holy Cave, one comes across the Sangam of Amravati
                    and Panjtarni rivers. Some pilgrims take bath at Amravati near the Holy Cave before going for
                    Darshan. There are two smaller Shivlings one of Maa Parvati and other of Shri Ganesh. It may be
                    noted that after having early Darshan of the Shiv Linga at Holy Cave, one can return to Panjtarni
                    well in time the same day.
                </p>

                <h6>VIA BALTAL</h6>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The distance between Jammu and Baltal can be covered by Taxis / Buses
                    available at Tourist Reception Centre, J & K / bus stand or one can come to Srinagar by air and then
                    reach Baltal by road. The road route followed is:
                <ul>

                    <li>Jammu </li>
                    <li>Banihal </li>
                    <li>Srinagar </li>
                    <li>Sonamarg </li>
                    <li>Baltal </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The journey from Jammu to Baltal, which is about 400 kms, passes through
                    beautiful valleys, waterfalls, and greenery all over gives you a new lease of life. A thrill, which
                    is obviously there in every pilgrim, gets enhanced while passing through this way owing to the
                    Darshan of Holy Cave.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Holy Cave is just 14 Kms from Baltal and the distance can be covered by
                    foot / Ponies. However, Dandies are also available for handicapped and old aged pilgrims.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The width of the pebbled (kuchha) road is a bit narrow as compared to
                    the Chandanwari-Holy Cave route, moreover, there are some steep rises & falls on the way, as
                    compared to the Chandanwari route, but pilgrims can return back to base camp Baltal through this
                    route only in one day
                </p>
